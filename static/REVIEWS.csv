Hardin de Asis,Edneil Jocusol,My review is for the pool only. I love how clean and clear the water was. There was no slime and the chlorine level was not strong.
Hardin de Asis,Donnie C Solis,"Hardin de Asis  is truly a hidden gem nestled in the heart of Tagaytay. I stayed here with my friends and also had the opportunity to organize an intimate wedding and I must say, the venue was perfect.

The rooms are spacious, clean, and well-appointed, providing a comfortable and cozy stay. They offer a wide range of amenities and facilities that cater to both leisure and events. Above all, The genuine care of the owner of this resort including her staff for their guests truly sets them apart.  They went above and beyond to ensure that every need of their clients are met.

Whether you're planning a weekend getaway, a special event, or simply seeking a peaceful retreat, this resort and events place will not disappoint. Hardin de Asis has got you covered. Can't wait to be back here soon <3"
Hardin de Asis,Pablito Ratuita ,"We really had a great time staying here from our last company outing. Surely, we will book again!!!

A peaceful and a very relaxing place for everyone. A very versatile accomodation that welcomes infants, children, couples, godparents, and even our pets.Also,  a nice place to celebrate weddings, workshops, and trainings."
Hardin de Asis,Anne Michelle Perea,Hardin is really like a home away from home. The place is spacious enough to hold parties and gatherings. The parking lot can accommodate an ample amount of cars for the guests. The garden is very well-maintained and has a gazebo which is a perfect photo spot for events. The pool is very clean and I like that there are lots of outdoor furniture where we can lounge at even while or after swimming. The rooms are big and clean. Love the bunk beds and big beds which can fit large groups. It's perfect for families and friends who would like to have a mini staycation. A very peaceful and serene place where we can relax and unwind away from the busy city life but still very accessible. 10/10 would recommend.
Hardin de Asis,Ramila Cruzado,BEAUTIFUL PLACE! Lovely garden and pool. Clean rooms and spacious facilities. Great price for a private resort as big as this. Staff are so accommodating too. Our family loves the place and we will definitely come again. RECOMMENDED!
Hardin de Asis,Michael Lew Madrid,Great place with ample space for garden weddings and a big function hall. Rooms with beds are also available for big groups.
Hardin de Asis,Norizza Lopez,"Almost a place like home, the facilities looks so calm and relaxing. Although the locks on the shower areas inside each room is somehow broken and was hard to close but the rest is wonderful and very comforting. The ambiance is also almost perfect! ♡"
Hardin de Asis,Carl Ramirez,This is a big place but looks old even though they say its relatively new! Lots of parking but awful staff. Their in the hospitality business yet they have none of it. There was almost no water the while time we were there! Almost all the adults werent able to take a bath for 2 days we were there. Half of the showers are broken which dosent really matter coz there is no water. They were charging us for extra drinking water yet there was no water to even brush your teeth! The staff wouldnt let us in the rooms because some one was doing an ocular. Apparently future business is more important than the actual guests. Did I mention there is no water!!!
Hardin de Asis,Francesca Perea,"It has been a great delight to stay at Hardin de Asis. Not only is it affordable considering their amenities, but the staff were pretty accomodating as well which has been the greatest factor of my stay there. It's good to see that they actually clean the water at the pool everytime a new batch of guests comes, instead of just using the same water again. Parking space is great as it fits the whole families cars and we're even a big family. Plus the, bamboo fence is such a big aesthetic. Thank you for letting us stay at Hardin de Asis! ♡♡♡"
Hardin de Asis,Horhe Flores,"We enjoy our stay in this place perfect for all kinds of events like bdays, weddings, or any family gatherings.The place is very spacious.Complete emeneties - parking can accomodate 20 maybe 30 cars, Dining hall can accomodate 100 to 150 pax, rooms good for 30 to 40 pax maybe 50 max.They habe complete kitchen utensils, gas and stove, ref, cook wares and grilling place.And their pool is so wide and the water is not too chlorinated.All in all this place is worth every peso.And also they are helping an cancer patients for every stay."
Hardin de Asis,Thea Leonen,"It was a great experience when we stayed there last month. The staff are very kind and accommodating. They politely explained to us that the videoke is just until 10PM due to Local government policy, which is understandable. That's the rules that the resort has to comply. The place is very chill and homey vibe. If you really want to rest and have quick weekend getaway, this place is perfect."
Hardin de Asis,allan yatco,"The place is very nice, it has an ample parkIng lot, a gazebo and a swimming pool, it has 4 large bedrooms with H/C showers. An activity area which sits 60-80 pax. A kitchen, ref and a videoke. I would highly recommend this place to aĺl my friends and family..."
Hardin de Asis,Daisy Manzanal-Cortez,"Had our company Christmas party here. We stayed overnight. The hall for the party is spacious enough. The rooms are adjoining so there is no privacy. Really annoying if you're with someone who snores. The next day they ran out of water, too bad for me, I was not able to take a bath."
Hardin de Asis,Victor Israel Espulgar,10/10 overall experience. Nice room and refreshing pool. The business responds promptly to inquiry and questions. Great for events and big group reunion. We will definetly return back here.
Hardin de Asis,Cirnyl Daa,Very kind and polite management. Super clean too! We had an ocular in the place and we saw them clean and disinfect. Highly recommended for private events.
Hardin de Asis,anisia GARCIA,"Had a great stay last Nov. 30. Tagaytay weather, peaceful, so relaxing and very accommodating staff. will surely be back again!! Thanks for the beautiful memories with family and friends. Badly needed this break during this  challenging year <3"
Hardin de Asis,Alea Christine Saludes,"The place is nice and spacious, however, their customer service is AWFUL. During the night of our visit, one of their personnels kept on telling us to keep quiet even though we were having a normal conversation. Bawal na nga mag swimming after 10pm, bawal pa magkwentuhan. After that, upon checkout naliligo pa yung mga kasama namin pinatayan na kami ng tubig kahit wala pang 12pm. Tapos sira pa ang ref, heater and marumi ang comfort rooms. They are all rude! This place is not worth your money! If you want to have fun and swim all night with your family, this is NOT the place for you. We will never go back there. WE HAD A VERY DISAPPOINTING AND AWFUL EXPERIENCE. You would only see positive reviews because they delete all the negative reviews of their resort!"
Hardin de Asis,Brian Arvin Garcia,"We had our Pre-nup pictorial, A good place to relax, and accomodating staff. We had a great time 🙂, thank you Ms. Nikki for accomodating Us ❤️💕❤️, Me and my wife highly recommend this Place. …"
Hardin de Asis,Daniel Jim De Jesus,The place is great for a family gathering or team building. Though the pool is a bit of a meh(it's only 5 ft) the rooms are superb
Hardin de Asis,John Peejay Serviano,Some of the bath facilities could have been better maintained. Otherwise it was a pleasant and fun stay.
Hardin de Asis,Gary Samson,Celebrated my niece's 5th birthday here and the place is awesome! Clean and quiet place.
Hardin de Asis,Neil Michael Galit,You'll feel at home and the staff were friendly and they'll answer any of your questions and inquiry without hiding anything and without feeling intimidated.
Hardin de Asis,Remar Evangelista,Nice and calm ambience (attended a wedding)
Hardin de Asis,Juana Angeles,Nice and chill. Very relaxed place.
Hardin de Asis,Aleine Leilanie Oro,Good venue for having small garden parties
Hardin de Asis,Marcelino Deseo,"Wide area, clean pool. friendly staff."
St. Augustine Parish,iain smith,"Beautiful church inside and out

Olaes Resort,Madel N.,"The staff are accommodating & considerate.

Since it was raining and we needed a place where we could gather all together other than the cottages provided, they allowed us to use their function hall for free."
Olaes Resort,leila aliel,"Recommended, very cost friendly. Our guests contributed around 500 pesos each and we had access to 2 pools, 3 cabanas, and free usage of karaoke, tables and chairs, and a bonfire. Very helpful and responsive staff."
Olaes Resort,2bandariyah,"Very nice accommodating people
Huge space for parking
The same goes for the swimming pool"
Olaes Resort,eric vincent miraflor,"I had my proposal here! Highly recommended for those who want to escape the busy metro. This is my second family and to those who want to visit alone, by group or with your family this is the best place to go to. You'll never regret this place guys. Once you're here, we'll treat you like our own. See you guys!"
Olaes Resort,gurley choi,"Best place to bring family to relax and enjoy away from the city! Olaes resort offers pool for adults and children, accommodations, cottages, spacious parking, wide lawn & garden. Perfect climate as it’s few mins away from Tagaytay!"
Olaes Resort,Lope Soriao,"Own by tatay alfredo and nanay marisa. This place is ownsome, it offer catering services, pool usage with two pool. It also cater transient, to visitor on their aircondition room. Function room is also available."
Olaes Resort,Cecilia Rafael,"I give it 5 star for privacy. I've been there few times & those times we have the entire swimming pool to ourselves :D me, my nephew & my niece :D"

Olaes Resort,Priss Capilo,Maganda sya sulit punta mo saka bayad
Olaes Resort,John Reve Malonzo,Maganda ang venue. Malaki and malinis ang pool. Maayos yung service at napaka friendly ng mga tao dito. Maganda rin yung mga rooms and amenities.
Paradizoo,O.A. Liebowitz,"My son had a blast here. You can feed a variety of animals, including ostriches, rabbits, ducks, and goats, as well as experience an immersive bee and butterfly garden. However, I’m slightly concerned about the wellbeing of certain animals. Some of them had obvious skin conditions."
Paradizoo,lorelie peregrino,"A very nice mini zoo,
The area is big
there are parking areas too,
Entrance fee is affordable but if you are  going to feed the animals you can add 300 pesos for the animal food.
Butterfly and bee area is a must. You can also bring your own food"
Paradizoo,Joseph Gumata,"Paradizoo Theme Park is kid and family friendly zoo/park. Other than seeing different kinds of animals, kids can interact with animals by feeding and taking photos with them. Their tour guides are very well mannered and informative. It is a good place for fun and learning."
Paradizoo,Reginald Belarmino,"It's a good place for kids and teens alike to visit. It's not as glamorous or diverse as other zoo places but what makes this special is it's niche in common farm animals, fruits and vegetable, as well as bees and butterflies. The place is spacious and clean while the attendants are all very helpful and friendly. They also have internship programs for aspiring business students. They attend the venue to learn about how to manage and keep the place running. Overall, our weekday experience was good. Having not too many guests made our trip and experience here quite pleasant and memorable."
Paradizoo,Leigh Feliciano Duragos III,"Latest info: 200 per head entrance, 150 for the animal feeds, 30 for butterfly and bee farm.

Went here Feb 2, 2022. There wasn't much visitors considering its a holiday. There are animals  to come take a look at like local horses, ostrich, ponies, pot bellied pigs, parakeets and more. Kids would definitely enjoy doing hands on with the animals. Watch out for the gang of ducks and chicken! They are going to follow you if they see you have bird feeds haha

Its best you bring your own food and snacks and hang out at the flower garden, there are tables and chairs available. Just make sure to keep the place clean and take your trash away with you. There are no stores available for you to get food or water so make sure you bring some.

Parking is ample, the place is quite large and kept clean. The park is a bit old and the pandemic hasn't helped at all in keeping things updated. Some structures and buildings seems unused and unkempt.

Overall, its still a good place to visit and bring kids with you"
Paradizoo,Ria Veronica Despi-Talan,This place was better than I expected. We enjoyed the close feeding encounters with the farm animals. They have a deal at Klook but we were not about to use it on a holiday. You also have to pay a separate fee for the activities. The place is big & has lots of places for photo opportunity. Though it was a struggle to visit on a rainy day. We recommend this place for families!
Paradizoo,Nico Rolle,"A nice and relaxing place to visit for the kids and for adults who love animals.

It is fun seeing the animals up close (ostriches, sheeps, ponies, deers, rabbits, hamsters) and walking with the others (ducks, pigs, goats) inside the farm.

Our 2 & 1/2 year old daughter happily fed the hamsters, rabbits, and goats. She also very much enjoyed the butterfly farm, one of the highlights of the theme park."
Paradizoo,Vernon Santos,"Animals are able to fully roam around the zoo. Bigger ones have open enclosures. Photos for me were ""forced"" since we were instructed to pose for photo ops on a lot of their photo spots. Other than that, experience of feeding most of the animals for toddlers were good."
Paradizoo,Border X-er,"The staff are nice and accommodating. There were farm animals that you can feed (their food should be bought from the ticket booth). There are also instagrammable areas where you can take your photos.

For 2 hours, we were only able to see 1/3 of the whole zoo. There were vegetable farm and gardens, but we weren't able to explore these parts (maybe soon). Btw, the cafe was open during our visit."
Paradizoo,Liz Lim,please take care of the animals. the animals look like they're sick and starving.
Paradizoo,Lyn Gaerlan,"I couldn't find the name of Paradizoo as our bus entered the parking lot reserved for buses at 8 a.m. Upon disembarkation, my group of students were assembled and escorted by a guide.

We passed an open field with cows and horses roaming freely.  Gazebo/huts called kubo can be found at some locations with comfort rooms, food and souvenirs.

We walked through several awesome gardens, and the butterfly and bee enclosures. There was a tree/seedling planting activity too.

They have an animal farm with feeding activities for rabbits, (among others) for an additional fee. Rides on horses, carabaos and camels are available.

The local and unique farm animals like the albino carabaos and gardens are amazing.

The route to the farm was a bit confusing, and signages would have been helpful to newcomers.

I can say that this escape from the city congestion, steel and concrete jungle is a must for everyone!"
Paradizoo,Jez Castro,"If you want a non-crowded place to visit in Tagaytay, this one is highly recommended. Kids and even adults will surely enjoy this place. Bringing your pet is allowed also inside the park."
Paradizoo,Jezz Sacro,"250 entrance fee is not worth it. Nothing to do and few animals. The animals were very thin and looked like they're sick. The garden also is not worth it, it just a normal plants that you can see everywhere. I was just thinking that the 1,900+ I pay is for the animals."
Paradizoo,Zephyriousity Ph,"The animals were too thin. I feel sorry for them when i visited Paradizoo. Also, the plants were withered. Hopefully, all is in goo hands now. its a beautiful place to become a waste.
The price is cheap and affordable. I got mine online."
Paradizoo,Neil Agapin,Such a lovely place to visit together with your family. We had a great time and wonderful memories. All animals is well cared and the staff is very accommodating. Hope to visit this place again and all the undergoing construction were finished.
Paradizoo,Paolo Umali,"The animals are only in a small section of the park. The only thing that made it worth the money is the feeding of the parakeets and its an extra fee to feed the animals. If you have kids and wants to see animals, go to zoori instead. But if you want zoo + big park then this is for you."
Paradizoo,Letty Alegre,"Re-visit after 5years, very big difference. This time, with very few animals, fowls not even a handful compares before, the same with floral plants and all other plants. With entrance fee this time to the butterfly & bee farm. All these, maybe due to lockdown because of global pandemic for almost a year now. But the green place is still refreshing."
Paradizoo,Shara Nox,Some of the animals here were sort of sick. But the highlight of our visit was the butterfly and beefarm. Theres a lesson for the kids they enjoyed it. A graveyard for animals too.
Paradizoo,Mylene Domingo,"a quick zoo experience to try when you’re tired with usual Tagaytay experience.

As per Dec 2022, entrance fee is just ₱199. Zoo is more of like a barn experience. Ducks, Geese, Pigs are roaming around and very people friendly."
Paradizoo,Pao Santos,The most interactive zoo I’ve ever been! Your kids will definitely enjoy this zoo!
Paradizoo,Jerikson Dones,The place was very clean and there’s a lot of scenic views. A great zoo to visit with your kids and to relax as well.
Paradizoo,Homer Olfindo,"A great place to spend your family weekend. Lots of unique animals that you cannot see in other zoo. There's camel, donkey and a lot more."
Paradizoo,G- Vito Lakwachero,Animals are well fed and taken care.
Paradizoo,April b,"U called urself a zoo, u can’t even take care of the dog on ur place. He doesn’t have bedding or water. He’s even in cage!! Pls take care of him!!"
Paradizoo,Nurshia Jusi,"we had so much fun!!!

We just really thank God for giving us a chance to enjoy our free gala time together.

Thanks Paradizoo!!!

Hoping next time, mas okay na yung playground area, ahahah."
Paradizoo,Janice Alvarez,"We have kids with us and wanted to see animals.  This was perfect.  Although far from Tagaytay proper so you need a car to get there.  The camel was the best part.  You can feed some of the animals and have interactions.  We fed camels,  ostrich,  birds,  ducks and goats.  It was a fun time.  The place was huge.  There's a vegetable farm and a butterfly farm.  So much to do that we spent all morning there.  We will go back if we ever go to Tagaytay again."
Paradizoo,Aldrien Sandoval,"My son had a great time exploring Paradizoo. At first, you might think the place is small entering the park. Look around it and you can also see planted vegetables and farm animals on top of the hill. It was educational as well. The guide showed us around and shared interesting facts of every farm animal. Look for ""Bull-tez-five"", a five-legged cow! Thank you Paradizoo!"
Paradizoo,Mary Grace Anacio,"Facility is poorly maintained. There's not much variety of animals and they looked skinny.
Staff- though the one who took our payment was nice but she didn't immediately offered that they have an in-house tour guide (free). Good thing I asked for it (because in Yoki's farm, they're the one who'll tell you about the tour guide). And the tour guide was in such a hurry that it's pretty obvious that she wanted to skip some of the areas.
Affordability, nah. You have to pay extra for the butterfly farm which is a very small area and not much to be seen."
Paradizoo,Justine Arcigal,Few animals were there but we enjoyed seeing their butterfly and bees farm.
Paradizoo,Warlito Datoon - GM,"It's not that bad, not that good either. Animals are mostly unwell. 800php for 5 photos is quite expensive nowadays."
Paradizoo,Miks Lico,Great! Hoping that they add more animals soon.
Paradizoo,NC P,"It's a mixed reaction for us who came all the way from pampanga to check out what the place has to offer.

I must agree with some who said the place is unkempt. Yes, it is. It could do a lot of keeping up, I'd say.

The staff were welcoming though and always ready with a smile. You will have to put up with their demand to do a ""v"" sign, a wave gesture, whatever, for a camera shot where you can pay for the picture before checking out the butterfly sanctuary. It ain't cheap, mind you. But then again, it's optional. So we skipped that and went on our way.

On top of the 200/head, you'll have to fork out extra to see the butterflies and the bees...

Nothing spectacular, yes. Sorry to dampen your spirits. You get to see a larger than life bull-tes-5. The park's main pride.

End of the day, I speak for myself, it's not really worth the drive from up north, esp me driving my flock there. Took us only less an hour to wander about and decided to leave and find other places of interest to shrug off the disappointing feeling."
Paradizoo,Rubie Namuco,"Please visit good place for family tour,company tour,educational tour,good ambiance ! 👌👌👌👍👍👍👍#farm&garder …"
Paradizoo,rhowen cabahug,"Nature awareness place. Vegetables, animals and plants are nice here"
Paradizoo,Victoria Comia,We paid Php199 entrance fee for adults and Php149 for kids. Would have been worth it if there are brochures/maps as to all that you can see and do in the zoo. I dont think we got the worth of the money we paid
Paradizoo,Noel Elpos,"Very satisfying, And me and my Family enjoyed."
Paradizoo,Soren Franco Regis,"It's a nice place for children's exposure to farm animals, and bees and butterflies. They also have gardens where the kids can play around. But for me this is more of a farm type of recreation and not a zoo, since you wouldn't see the usual zoo animals - lion, tiger, giraffe, elephant, and others...

What we didn't like about the place is their restaurant, the service is very slow, the place is a bit untidy, and the food we ordered was too salty..."
Paradizoo,Mohit Jagger,"My 4 year old simply had a blast. Cute little piggies following her around. Feeding the birds, rabbits and all the other farm animals was fun. Staff was friendly and they guide us we'll. Piggies were the best."
Paradizoo,Rachel Sidocon,"The place is not worth of of the price of the entrance fee. Not worth of the time if you come from far place, like Manila. You get to feed some few farm sickly animals and that just it. You'll visit a wide place, supposed to be a garden but was not taken care of. Felt like employees don't take care of the place very well."
Paradizoo,Mark Darrel Gonzales,Great place to visit with family! Fun activities for kids too like animal feeding. Sarap balikan! 👍 …
Paradizoo,Emilia Jamie Gaviola,Nice place though staff could be more hospitable & welcoming. We were the only family to visit and yet we're not properly guided as to where to go or how to get to a place. It was a massive park. A tour guide could've been handy.
Paradizoo,Ivan Thei Masayon,Did not enjoy our visit here. Animals are somewhat neglected and no guide for the tour
Paradizoo,Cynthia Lacsa,"Needs more improvement on the place and maintenance, with very limited amenities to explore. Also, there is no tour guide that will assist the visitors, in that case I suggest you provide handouts of maps to guide the guests. The kids only enjoyed feeding the parakeets."
Paradizoo,Ashley Uy,Nice place to unwind. Just within Mendez-Tagaytay area.
Paradizoo,Paula Jeanne,It was very interactive for my kid. I liked how she was able to feed the animals but they could improve the place more and show a little compassion for the species since their cages weren't that well kept. Some animals were wounded and some skinny. They need to be visited by a vet every once in a while to make sure their still in good condition.. I'd give it a five or four because it made my kid so happy but for now three will do until changes are made. I will definitely bring my kid back.
Paradizoo,bong cambi,Nice place to visit when you're in tagaytay
Paradizoo,kevin brister,"Not much to see , but my kids enjoyed it!"
Paradizoo,Hazel Tempongko,"staff are very nice, friendly and accommodating. as for the zoo, nothing much to see as they only have mostly farm animals. but my daughters love feeding and interacting with the animals"
Paradizoo,Sky Walker Vlogs,Me and my family went to paradizoo last December 2022 and we did have fun feeding the animals and picture taking.
Paradizoo,Bogan Goh,Not worthy for the price 3person coming up to 1k plus. And it just small
Paradizoo,Jess Flores,This is a must visit place in tagaytay if you are travelling with kids. We (adults) have enjoyed strolling around while the kids had fun feeding the animals!
Paradizoo,Nikolay,The best zoo i have visited. Many birds and animals can contact with and feed. Very enjoyable.
Paradizoo,Viola Marie,"I love the place! but it's not stroller friendly. Avoid getting online vouchers. I bought 2 vouchers online. They said it 698 per pax but with 50% off from them, its 349 php. But if you just walk in it is just 299php zoori with paradizoo. So don't give in to their false advertisement."
Paradizoo,Cynt Herrera,"About 10 hectares area filled with farm animals and some exotic ones with organically grown vegetables and fruits for picking and for sale, located at Mendez, Cavite. Kids and adults will enjoy touring the site via golf car."
Paradizoo,Joshua Guilalarte,Approachable staff. Great experience
Paradizoo,Feona Kiara S. Lavares,Had a lot of activities and picture taking spots. The flower garden is also very gorgeous! But we hope you still continue the vegetable garden <3.
Paradizoo,Pew Pew,"Remember it is a theme farm. Service is wonderful. There isn't a wide range of animals to begin with, that's what put off the experience. The butterfly enclosure is small and uncomfortable."
Paradizoo,Dane DC,"Simple, humble and nice zoo. Small collection of animals, but its enough for the size if the place. It's nice to support the owner, keeping the area clean, animals healthy and happy 😊. …"
Paradizoo,Cheryll,The farm animal area is not-so clean and well-maintained. The garden is relaxing. The butterfly and bee area is too small.
Paradizoo,Vanessa Jeanne Cruz,public restrooms are not accessible all the time. no outside food and drinks allowed for picnic. zoo cages are mostly smelly and dirty. grass needs trimming.
Paradizoo,nishtha jain,"Great place to develop bonding with animals. Follow their blue, pink or green path to discover the farm animals, flower garden or vegetable garden. All animals are domesticated and taken care of with love."
Paradizoo,Ronald Guerrero,"Ok for the Kids. Domesticated animals, flowers and vegetables available"
Paradizoo,Kyiel Zurbito,Super fun for the kiddo. There's so many aggressive duckies following U around. 😂😂 …
Paradizoo,Jay-anne Dichosa-Gadia,We were supposed to milk the goat and sheer the wool of the sheep however all of the wools were collected and well I guess the same thing goes for the goat's milk. The rest of the activities went well.
Paradizoo,GP,"There is no water provided to some animals, they look thirsty and lonely. I hope this zoo will be looked after. The costs doesn't match what is inside."
Paradizoo,Judith Gatchalian,"few animals only. place is not well maintained esp the place where the animals are kept. the garden is nice. quite expensive,not worth it."
Paradizoo,Gladys Presa,"Love this place, pede ang kids 😊 …"
Paradizoo,itsjust mel,"Nice enough place for a one time visit. A bit costly for what you get but when I think it helps them maintain the place and animals, it is ok."
Paradizoo,Derick Cuyo,"Whilst there's more to improve on the overall operations of the zoo, buying fruits, veggies and plants here is exciting because they're cheap and fresh."
Paradizoo,Rica Alyssa,Not much to see. The only good thing here is animal feeding. But the feeds are too expensive
Paradizoo,Ramon C. Villaruz Jr.,"Yes i like that place 🙂 we can do relax and enjoying the good weather for seeing bird, trees, animals,and flowers. …"
Paradizoo,Espie Delos Santos,Expensive for what they can offer. Limited animals and place is not clean enough for a leisure farm
Paradizoo,deepi dubb,It was ok to roam about.. but u have to carry ur baby can't roll the stroller.
Paradizoo,Tabitha Delos Santos,Not so many animals. I think its not worth the price.
Paradizoo,JR Recto,Kids will surely love this place as farm animal interactions is a must. With butterfly and bees farm.
Paradizoo,Paul De Guia,Place was nice and the people are very accomodating. My Toddler enjoyed the Love Birds experience.
Paradizoo,Charmaine Cani,Animals and cages are not well kept.
Paradizoo,K A,Cages are not well maintained. No water for the animals in their cages. P199 entrance fee is not worth it. It's like QC Wildlife zoo outside the metro.
Paradizoo,George Jizmundo,"The experience is okay. You can feed the animals but there are animals that seems not okay. For the price, it is pricey in relation to what you'll get."
Paradizoo,Rina Reviews,Theme parks are good but I think it will be more okay if its clean.
Paradizoo,Verge Cruz,Very stacked with animals. I specifically liked the butterfly garden.

Paradizoo,Klein Herrera,Maganda at mlaki ang place. Kaya magdala kau ng cam. Malawak ang garder. Saka pwede ka mag feed ng mga farm animals. Maganda sya para sa mga batang taga city na bihira makakita ng animal.

Paradizoo,Alexander Angeles,Panget madumi pati cr madumi sayang pera X X X.  Magkakasakit lng bata dito.

Yoki's Farm,Wilson Antolin,"""The place is well maintained and clean. You will see unusual selections of animals (e.g., alpacas, capybaras, cassowaries) and they all look well-fed and happy. Food at their in-house restaurant is decent and not overpriced too. Overall, it was a great experience for me and my family."""
Yoki's Farm,Simon Pavel Miranda,"""About 1.5 hrs from NAIA, a great place for families to enjoy... not too big making it easy to navigate. Food though is quite expensive and serving is small. Tour guide was funny and amiable."""
Yoki's Farm,Wesley Yu,"""A really fun farm/zoo to go to and see some cool and interesting animals up close. It's very kid-friendly with a playground. They also have a cafe and eating area and a gift shop. I think they also sell fresh produce when available."""
Yoki's Farm,Bryan Cariaga,"""Pretty fun experience. My toddler enjoyed it too. Will definitely be coming back here again."""
Yoki's Farm,Liz Lim,"""Fantastic experience! The animals look like they're taken care of well and have plenty of space to roam around. The tour guide is super knowledgeable and very friendly. Would visit here again."""
Yoki's Farm,Stephanie Lou Lumongsod,"""Fun and interactive. The animal encounter activity is very kid-friendly! Aviary walkthrough and bird petting are already included in the basic tour. You can pick mulberries for free, buy plants, and hire a personal guide. Lunch service is slow though."""

Yoki's Farm,Lukas Gabriel Sanchez,"""Love everything even though the dogs were in an air-conditioned room. I still had fun feeding animals such as birds, horses, etc."""
Yoki's Farm,Mitzi Sanchez,"""This place is surprisingly operating amidst pandemic restrictions. Kids and senior citizens are allowed to enjoy, relax, explore, and breathe fresh air in an orchidarium, hydroponics farm, museum, and animal sanctuary. This is perfect for family bonding!"""
Yoki's Farm,Jonard Zamora,"""To be fair, it is just a farm, not a zoo. But we expected more animals. The area is clean and well-maintained I must say. The tour guide (Jolina) is very informative and she allowed us to feed the rabbits and turtles even though we availed a basic package."""
Yoki's Farm,BerZ3rker 360,"""Lovely place with a friendly guide. The animals look healthy and well-fed, their cages are big and look well-maintained by the staff. Big parking area in front."""

Enchante Farm,Jer P.                ,"|If you want to experience Tagaytay weather but in a farm setting, this place might be the one for you. Good for team building or staycation. A must try their affordable but good ramen in their newly opened Ramen House inside Enchante.   "
Enchante Farm,Joaquin Cabunag,"Memorable and unforgettable stay last July! My family loved the place for the peaceful sight of God's creation.  I recommend the resort to families, barkadas, and team building companies since the place is wide, and we can roam around freely unlike staying in a room hotel. I hope they include spa & massage services it would be a wonderful addition to their amenities completing a relaxing staycation. Lastly, my family enjoyed their fishing activity where the staffs have guided us all throughout. Thank you enchante for having us."
Enchante Farm,zyrus biado,"The ramen was incredible, and the Japanese architecture added to the experience, making it truly immersive! I highly recommend it. Thanks to Magnolia team for a quick yet worthwhile treat"

Enchante Farm,Sheridan Puddunan,Well recommended for a place to relax.
Enchante Farm,Trisha Nicole Salenga,"Location was easy to manage since they are available on Waze. They send all instructions and guides before and upon check-in which was commendable since not all resorts would be informative, so kudos to enchante! I will surely come back for another peaceful stay, away from the busy world of Manila"
Enchante Farm,ADRIAN CATACUTAN,Catering services is allowed at their place when my group  booked at their place 😁 Just arrange and communicate with enchante's booking team so that they can assist and help you for further details. Has wide vicinities and very private; Grab is also accessible and there are nearby aesthetic cafes; the best for group staycations!! …

Enchante Farm,17_m,The place is very peaceful. We always get to relax in this place ❤️
Enchante Farm,Ali Silao,Lack of hospitality and courtesy for guests. Definitely NOT a good place to stay and feel welcomed.
Enchante Farm,Mary Rose Medina,super worth it ng staycation.. been ther for 5 times now I think :) super bait nila kuya Rey :)
Enchante Farm,Michael Hagamann,They have business related problem vs hacienda solange. No structure of management how they will fix their own problem. Guest will suffer for sure.

Noon Cafe,rhnzrs,"Noon Cafe at Mendez is a lovely spot with a quiet and very aesthetic atmosphere. The ambiance is perfect for a relaxing break or catching up with friends. We ordered drinks and pastries, which were quite good. However, the prices were on the higher side. Despite this, the overall experience was pleasant, making it worth a visit for those who appreciate a serene and visually pleasing cafe."
Noon Cafe,Sen Mbb,"We visited Noon Cafe since it was near our staycation. The place itself is spacious, so it never feels crowded. We really enjoyed their lasagna and flatbread—they’re delicious and reasonably priced for the portion and quality. Definitely worth a visit! We will visit again soon to try their pastry."
Noon Cafe,Nic Merc,"The neighbor sound system is noisy destroying the Noon’s ambience. It’s a good place to relax albeit the noise mentioned, and personnel are friendly. Coffee + Egg Benedict was very good; highly recommended place if you have a lot of time to spend. The place is secluded inside a Taal like neighborhood."
Noon Cafe,Alison Perey,"Amazing Cafe, wide selection of classic and fancy drinks, foods ranging from classic filipino dishes to some known international cuisines.. Fair price compare to other cafes that I visited. Staffs are friendly and looks well trained professional... Aesthetic place matching its minimalist interior.. A must try cafe and surely youll enjoy your dining experience.."
Noon Cafe,Divina Grace Cordenete,"The staff are really warm and welcoming. My dog and I had to sit outside but they were nice enough to give us a fan so we don’t feel hot.
Food is good. I had fish and chips and passion punch.
For some reason, my dog didn’t like her pupcup.
Parking space is enough for a few cars
We went there on a weekday afternoon so it’s not crowded. Will come back for sure."
Noon Cafe,Dustin Carbonera,"What a hidden gem. Nestled inside Mendez/Alfonso is Noon Cafe. It is really hidden as it is inside a small community and you have to go inside a small road before you get in. Very airy and cozy, and food is good! Coffee is good too as they know their coffee and beans!"
Noon Cafe,Rey Nocum,"The place is so popular despite being located in a remote area.
Parking space is good for a few cars only. On weekends during lunch or dinner, you may need to park on a road more than 50m away from its entrance.
Based on the ambiance and taste of food and drinks we ordered I can say that there's a reason why this café has become a favorite of some people."
Noon Cafe,Reika Arakawa,"The place is quiet and well-kept. A great place to relax and dine. The staffs are friendly.
The food is good for the price but the coffee was even better."
Noon Cafe,Glenn Tupaz,Nice relaxing place. A bit hidden but trust the map. Very spacious with ample parking.
Noon Cafe,Ms C,Great Coffee 🤍 Good Food 🤍 Pet friendly 🤍 …
Noon Cafe,Rian Jacobe,"A hidden crown in Mendez, Cavite. This place is nature-friendly due to it's location. Food and beverages are affordable, and the taste is okay. One issue I found is that there are lots of mosquitoes which is a bit concerning, but I'm sure it's a workable thing that the owner can fix."
Noon Cafe,Kate Salcedo,The baristas are friendly! Calming atmosphere where you can chill and catch up woth friends! They offer rice meals and pastas too! Their bread and soup is the best! Open till 10pm!
Noon Cafe,Luar Joy Dela Cruz,Weekends are busy days. Many customers but we manage to have a seat. The place is nice also if you want to experience nature vibes because it's surrounded with trees. The food is good for its price.

Noon Cafe,Rain Diaz,Somewhere in the back of Mendez is a beautiful cafe with a very chilled vibe. Coffee was really good.
Noon Cafe,Anson,"The food is great! I love how it tries to emulate west food, like sandwiches, pizza, and more. As well as the drinks. The venue itself is good for it's size, like how a modern coffee shops like. However, many are similar to this kind of venue."

Noon Cafe,Debbie Quilang,The food serve fast plus tasty and delicious specially their pasta's and club sandwich.
Noon Cafe,Rozelle Kuan Lopez,This is the place if you need a quiet time away from the city. It's a bit far though pero sulit nman. Pwede ka mag muni2 of course with coffee & your favorite snack. Food is ordinary nothing much to expect. Not that pricey affordable naman. All day breakfast is available. For sure babalik kami to try iba food. Friendly staff & malinis CR. Not crowded since weekday kami nag punta.

Tres Tesoros Private Villa,Blaise Alessandro,"Great vacation/retreat venue for large groups. The dining & pool area are well designed for parties, hanging out, or relaxation. Pool is nicely sized with a cool little waterfall spot & a small jacuzzi/bubble feature. The area is well lit at night. There’s access to an outdoor grill & a room for cooking needs. Lots of spaces: parking, bonfire, Instagram spots, & rooms. Rooms can be deceivingly spacious. All areas are exceptionally cleaned & maintained. In-house staff are super helpful. Cons: noisy dogs, narrow/uneven roads."
Tres Tesoros Private Villa,Henson Adam ,Thank you for the warm hospitality and exceptional accommodation during our stay. Ms. Julianna even prepared a welcome gift for us. Your attention to detail and friendly staff made our experience truly memorable. We appreciate the effort you put into ensuring guests feel welcomed and cared for. Looking forward to returning soon! Salamat and kudos to all staff.
Tres Tesoros Private Villa,Andy D.,"Nice place for a staycation or formal event. Amenities include big parking, a kitchen + pantry (no dishwashing), 1 pool, 3 big rooms, a large covered lounge/event area, and a bonfire. If you're looking for a taste of nature, this is NOT the place since the aesthetic is more modern. Beware of dogs when you go down to the villa. Rent for 22 hours is around 20k."
Tres Tesoros Private Villa,Loren Roasa,"Went here for a team Christmas party early December. The place looks really good, day AND night! Pool is not heated & the wind can be cold at night. Floor can be REALLY slippery; not recommended for accident-prone/PWD family/relatives. Owner & staff were very helpful with our concerns. Thank you! "
Tres Tesoros Private Villa,SJ S.,"It was a gem to find this villa. The owner and staff were very accommodating with our needs. The entire place was clean, spacious, and secured—perfect for big family gatherings. They have all the necessary facilities for a comfortable stay. Parking within the area can securely fit more than 5 vehicles. Highly recommended and would love to be back again. 😊"
Tres Tesoros Private Villa,bri barba,"Great venue for swimming outings, meetings, conferences, and facilities are properly maintained."
Tres Tesoros Private Villa,Mickie Perez,"The place is super spacious and the rooms are comfy! No need to bring kitchen and dinnerware because they have a kitchen to cook, and they also have a griller. Perfect place to bond with family! The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. They have enough parking if there are many of you. 🤍"
Tita Lola's House,Rian Jacobe,"Iconic house from the 2018 movie, ""The Hows of Us"" of Kathniel. Note: We asked permission from the owner before taking photos."
Tita Lola's House,mee moo,Do not come here. Do not waste your time. You are no longer allowed to take pictures or visit/go inside the house; the housekeeper is also mean and rude. 0/10 ruined the experience. Could've handled the situation better!
Tita Lola's House,zon pomarca,The How's of Us movie.
Tita Lola's House,Kyle Gregorio,Double aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Visited on Weekend…
Kalmado Campsite,Oscar Cornejo,"Car camping for nature lovers. Plenty of trees to shade your tent and hang your hammock. Feel the coolness of Tagaytay even in summer, especially at night. You can hear chirping of birds in the morning. Camping area is well-lighted at night, gated and fenced for security. Courteous and helpful crew. Internet signal available for Globe & Gomo subscribers. CR with running water available."
Kalmado Campsite,t3ch,"If you are looking for a ""near Manila"" spot to chill and camp with friends, this is the place to be. The campsite accommodates around 15 groups. They offer Tapsilog if you do not have food to cook. Camping gear rentals available, but at your own risk due to the pandemic."
Kalmado Campsite,Jonathan Pony,"The place is very peaceful. As the name suggests ""Kalmado,"" from the entrance gate to the camping site, it’s clean. Friendly and hospitable staff. Highly recommend for a camping place closest to the city."
Kalmado Campsite,Joseph Parreno,"Kalmado Campsite is in Campground Zambal Road Tagaytay Cavite. Recommended for camping experiences with family and friends. Pets allowed. Bring camping tools like tent, portable stove, hammock, and food. Enjoy the perfect atmosphere and fresh air. Passable for any types of cars."
Kalmado Campsite,ELIAS,"As a first-time camper, my experience was great. Relaxing and detoxing from the internet was refreshing and helped my mental health. It’s very cold, so bring jackets and pajamas. Overall, the view and vibes here are awesome. Try camping with friends or family!"
Kalmado Campsite,ruth miranda,"First time camping with family. There were 4 groups: 3 families and 1 couple. The people are kind and accommodating, but it was noisy at night from nearby transient houses with videoke until 2am. If you’re looking for serenity, ask about minimizing noise from videoke if possible."
Kalmado Campsite,Faceless Wanderer,"The campsite is nice; you can bring your fur children. Don't forget insect repellents because there are many bugs and mosquitoes, especially at night. One toilet and one shower room available; water offered for sale. Not for ""maselan"" groups of campers."
Kalmado Campsite,Jerome Santos,Recommended for chill campers. Hope they add more shower and restroom facilities in the future. Overall experience was fun and relaxing. 👌

Kalmado Campsite,Ramle Nitram,Tagaytay feels excellent; it's very cold and quiet. Fresh because there are many trees. Hammock rental costs 200 pesos per head overnight. You'll relax here. 😘 
Kalmado Campsite,Jaypee Villanueva (Jhay),"Super cold and super quiet, very good."
Kalmado Campsite,Michael Cabangunay,Do not hesitate to go.
Juana's Private Resort,Marcelino Santos,"Big pool, nice rooms, plenty of beds with foam, with karaoke, wifi, strong water outlet. Big space for events. Mabait ang caretaker."

Bukid Pamana,Angela Diaz,Visited last Sept. 29 to celebrate my birthday. Host/owner is very kind and understanding and the place is so nice even for our short stay due to weather condition we enjoyed and had time to relax. Will come back for sure. Thank you Bukid Pamana for the warm welcome 🥰
Bukid Pamana,Ride & Juander,"Went here for a motocamping on their Mahogany Forest. The hosts are very accommodating, they have clean facilities and the CR is well-maintained. They have various cabins also for rent if you prefer to stay on a much comfortable space, they have swimming pool, mini-obstacle courses (on their mahogany grounds), and they have various plantations of fruits that you can visit. The campsite has mobile signal and electricity if in case you'll need to charge your stuffs. Overall, the place suits especially for beginners who wanted to try camping. 🏕️"
Bukid Pamana,Brian Samarita,The place is nice and wide. Mabait din ung owner as well as their helper. Highly recommended for camping.

Bukid Pamana,HISMNL,"There are a lot of ants, which is a problem, but it's a campsite I'd like to go to again."
Bukid Pamana,Ma. Anna Patrisha Baldonado,The cold!
Loft - Mendez,Malu Cunanan,"The design of the house, the view and the location are great; however, the place is very hot. We did not sleep well due to flies and heat. The pool was unusable because of flies, billiard pool had broken cues, and comfort rooms smelled unpleasant. Comments for the owner’s consideration."
Loft - Mendez,A D,"We booked Loft for our prenup shoot. Booking process was okay, responsive staff. Upon arrival, welcomed by caretaker, gave keys and collected deposit. Loft good for prenup shoot, not recommended for staycation. Bathrooms had a foul smell, dirty tiles and flooring, old shower heads. Beds had ants. Food service was slow and charged extra fees. Admin's attitude was unprofessional. Caretakers were courteous. Good location for prenup shoot but not for staycation. Hope admin is not the owner as their attitude is unsuitable for service industry."
Loft - Mendez,Aki,"Nice loft house, downside is it’s in the middle of nowhere. Delivery and transportation issues encountered."
Loft - Mendez,Danielle Agustin,"Great for prenup shoot, responsive hosts. Hot inside due to glass walls, no air-conditioning. Gave 5 stars for service after retrieving a lost engagement ring."
Loft - Mendez,Gellie Prieto,"Avail prenup shoot package, good deal. Clean place, good weather. Extra charges for billiards and cooking. Mini coffee shop cozy and great for photos."
Loft - Mendez,Fhabi Fajardo,"Frontline person was very unprofessional, difficult to communicate with and hung up. Waste of time to check on the place."
Loft - Mendez,Czalea Pano,"Celebrated dog's birthday there, owner nice and allowed 5 dogs inside. Checked in early and safe with CCTV. Price worth it"

The Tapsi Shop,Rozelle Kuan Lopez,Good food. Tapsi is so soft & melts in your mouth. Big serving & very affordable. Sisig is also the best.
The Tapsi Shop,Paula Marie Bereber,Pusilog is a personal fave. Dine here a couple of times but quality of food doesn't change. Just be prepared for a long waiting time as food ordered is freshly cooked.
The Tapsi Shop,Peej Urtica (Peej),They killed a poor hungry puppy by hurling it into the pavement and it died instantly. Do not patronize this Indio establishment as cleanliness isn’t being followed...
The Tapsi Shop,daphne prodigo,Good food. Affordable prices. I just wish they offer other drinks though. Juice choices are too sweet when we ate there. Sisig lumpia and tapa style corned beef is good.
The Tapsi Shop,Joiada Sinclair,Tapa and pusit are very tender👍👍👍…

Bueanaventura's Garden Cafe,Ai G,"Affordable place with garden view. Their food is also tasty, we had pumpkin soup, sisig & nachos and all of them are recommended. Their chairs though are so heavy and uncomfy but overall, they are a great place to chill."
Bueanaventura's Garden Cafe,Joel Rosh Balbuena,The place comes alive at night as well. Resonably priced menu items and the taste is amazingly good. Definitely a trip worth taking if you're in the Tagaytay area! The staff were accommodating and friendly plus we didn't have to wait too long for our order. Definitely recommend the barbeque pork belly! Highly recommended and will definitely be back.
Bueanaventura's Garden Cafe,Luis Isuga,"The food was great. They have a hefty amount of serving for each dish which for me justifies its price. I ordered Chicken Parmigiana, it's not that al dente. It's on the softer side but it's not over cooked which is a good thing. I personally enjoyed the dish. Great tomato taste on pasta. The chicken was cooked well and it was fillet so less hassle on deboning it. Overall: It was a tummy-filling experience. There's nothing we ordered that is a super flop."
Bueanaventura's Garden Cafe,Kleo Kannangara,Their pastas are very tasty and portioned quite  big.  We haven't ordered anything here that we were disappointed with.  Both food and drinks are excellent.
Bueanaventura's Garden Cafe,Gemmae Digno-Maestre,"Big serving, tasty food, good ambience & approachable staffs!"

Sancturio Nature Farms,Katherine Calingasan,"A perfect place to bring your family and commune with nature. See how they grow their vegetables, herbs and fruits naturally. They also have animals in the farm, like native pigs, free range chicken, goats, rabbits and heritage chickens. You're family can also ask for a guided tour and learn what they have and how they do things in the farm. It's also an option if you want to have snacks in the farm. You can also bring your own food. They also offer seminars about farming. Contact them on their fb page for inquiries and reservation."
Sancturio Nature Farms,J M,"Love the place! They've got a plant nursery, chicken run, and rows of vegetable garden. I learned a lot of ideas that we can use in our backyard. The guide was very helpful and shared a lot of useful information. My mother got lettuce, flower cuttings, seeds, and more. They also offer a two-week, stay-in Organic Agriculture apprenticeship program (which I think is TESDA accredited). The place needs better upkeep, but they said they don't have enough manpower due to the pandemic."
Sancturio Nature Farms,Shawi Cortez,"Organic veggies and eggs! 🥰 you can PM them via FB messenger to ask about their fresh produce for the day and place your order. If you specify the time of pick up, they harvest it just a few minutes before your scheduled pick up time. Ganun ka fresh!"
